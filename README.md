# Milestone 1 submission
## Team name
NoTiFy

## Proposed level of achievement 
Gemini

## Aim
We aim to create a website whereby students can collaborate to
create and share notes that supports MarkUp languages and
commonly-used note taking formats. By providing a user-friendly
and feature-rich environment for note-taking and sharing, our
platform will facilitate effective learning and knowledge sharing
among students. In addition, our goal is to provide a comprehensive
study material creation tool that streamlines the process of
organising and accessing notes for students. By offering a
centralized platform for note-taking, our tool will enable students
to easily locate and review their study materials in a convenient
and efficient way.

## Motivation
<p align="justify">
As computer science students, the modules that we have taken so far have required us to create our own notes, as well as cheatsheets for the exams. A commonly used tool for collaborative notemaking amongst students is Google Docs. However, we realised that it was almost impossible to create a cheatsheet that was space-efficient, due to the strict formatting rules permitted on Google Docs. It was also difficult to format the notes in the ways we desire. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
One possible solution to these issues was to use other platforms such as Overleaf, which supports MarkUp languages, thus allowing for more control over how we can format our notes. Platforms like Miro and Canva are also helpful if we intend to create a mindmap or brainstorm for ideas with others. However, by using multiple applications to manage our notes, we increase the inconvenience we face while trying to revise for our exams. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Hence, we wondered if it was possible to have a collaborative website that has a text editor which supports MarkUp languages as well as other note formats, such as an exam cheatsheet, flashcards, post-it notes and diagrams, thus allowing us to manage all our notes on a single platform.
