# Milestone 1 submission
## Team name
NoTiFy

## Proposed level of achievement 
Gemini

## Aim
We aim to create a website whereby students can collaborate to
create and share notes that supports MarkUp languages and
commonly-used note taking formats. By providing a user-friendly
and feature-rich environment for note-taking and sharing, our
platform will facilitate effective learning and knowledge sharing
among students. In addition, our goal is to provide a comprehensive
study material creation tool that streamlines the process of
organising and accessing notes for students. By offering a
centralized platform for note-taking, our tool will enable students
to easily locate and review their study materials in a convenient
and efficient way.

## Motivation
<p align="justify">
As computer science students, the modules that we have taken so far have required us to create our own notes, as well as cheatsheets for the exams. A commonly used tool for collaborative notemaking amongst students is Google Docs. However, we realised that it was almost impossible to create a cheatsheet that was space-efficient, due to the strict formatting rules permitted on Google Docs. It was also difficult to format the notes in the ways we desire. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
One possible solution to these issues was to use other platforms such as Overleaf, which supports MarkUp languages, thus allowing for more control over how we can format our notes. Platforms like Miro and Canva are also helpful if we intend to create a mindmap or brainstorm for ideas with others. However, by using multiple applications to manage our notes, we increase the inconvenience we face while trying to revise for our exams. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Hence, we wondered if it was possible to have a collaborative website that has a text editor which supports MarkUp languages as well as other note formats, such as an exam cheatsheet, flashcards, post-it notes and diagrams, thus allowing us to manage all our notes on a single platform.
</p>

## Vision
<p align ="justify">
We envision NoTiFy to be an important collaborative note taking tool where users will be able to easily create and share their knowledge and content. This will be achieved through the users employing the available features on the website, such as MarkUp language support, allowing for a more convenient and flexible note-taking experience. Users can also save time by choosing from the wide range of templates that we provide for various note types.
</p>

## User stories
<p align="justify">
  
1. As a student, I can create a cheat sheet for my exam using the markdown language note creation feature on NoTiFy so that I have greater control over the typesetting and formatting of my document than if I used Google Docs or Microsoft Word that only provides a rich text editor.
  
2. As a student, I can collaborate with friends to create notes or cheatsheet, so that I can spare more time to work on other assignments and projects.
  
3. As a student, I can collaborate with friends to make notes, and read their understanding of the topic and compare it with mine so that I can identify which parts I need to work on and learn from them. As a student, if I have doubts about my friendsâ€™ notes, I can point them out by commenting on that specific section, so that they can learn and correct their mistakes.
  
4. As a student who uses many different note formats to study for various subjects (e.g. flashcards for medical science, cheat sheets for math and slides for history) I want all my notes all in one platform so that I can access them easily without having many applications and websites open just to find my notes.

## Features
- Webpage
  - Hosting
    - Proposed: MongoDB database and collections to be hosted on MongoDB Atlas, 
    - Current progress: MongoDB database and website are hosted locally. 
  - Account management
    - Proposed: Users will be able to register accounts with email authentication.
    - Current progress: Basic registration and login features implemented. Authentication with JsonWebToken implemented.
  - File management
    - Proposed: Users will be able to upload, share with other users, edit and download their files on the platform. 
    - Current progress: Working on rudimentary file upload and download with the Multer and GridFS packages.
- Text editor
  - Rich text editor:
    - Proposed: An in-house rich text editor whereby users are able to select if they want to create a regular document or a document that supports MarkUp source code.
    - Current progress: Implemented a rich-text-editor using the Quill package.
  - MarkUp language support:
    - Proposed: Users will be able to use our text editors to type in MarkUp source code (Markdown and LaTeX support planned) and export the file as a PDF. There will be a real time side-by-side view of MarkUp source code and output PDF implemented as well. 
    - Current progress: Identified React packages such as KaTeX and react-markdown that will help us implement this feature.
  - Additional types of notes:
    - Proposed: Users will be able to select which type of document they would like to create when they attempt to create a new set of notes. Planned types of notes: A4 cheat sheet, post-it notes, flashcards, mind-maps, diagrams.
- Collaborative Features

    - Proposed: Users will be able to share files with each other. Once a user is granted permission to access a file, he/she will be able to edit and download it.
  - Concurrent editing:
    - Proposed: Multiple users will be able to edit the same file concurrently. 
  - Communication:
    - Proposed: A comment and reply system will be implemented, along with a live chat function.
