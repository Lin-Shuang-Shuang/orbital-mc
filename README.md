Gemini

## Aim
We aim to create a website whereby students can collaborate to
create and share notes that supports MarkUp languages and
commonly-used note taking formats. By providing a user-friendly
and feature-rich environment for note-taking and sharing, our
platform will facilitate effective learning and knowledge sharing
among students. In addition, our goal is to provide a comprehensive
study material creation tool that streamlines the process of
organising and accessing notes for students. By offering a
centralized platform for note-taking, our tool will enable students
to easily locate and review their study materials in a convenient
and efficient way.

## Motivation
As a computer science student, most, if not all of the midterms 
and finals we have taken so far required us to make our own notes 
for revision, as well as cheatsheets. It is nearly impossible to 
create an efficient cheatsheet on google docs, especially for 
content heavy modules, as there would be too much space wastage.
It is also challenging to format the notes in various ways to fit
our needs. Hence we often need to rely on an external app or website
for cheatsheets. This creates a slight inconvenience as notes would be
on separate platforms despite belonging to the same module, thus 
affecting our revision.

Besides, to create a new cheatsheet on overleaf for example, would 
require one to search for a cheatsheet template on google, copy and paste
the code on the website, which is a hassle.

When students want to collaborate on document creation, be it an exam cheat sheet, tutorial notes or otherwise, the most popular choice currently is through Google Drive.
However, due to the formatting limitations of Google Drive, many students might not be satisfied by the options it offers. It does not support the use of MarkUp languages, which provide greater control over the design of their documents to the user.
To access these features, students would have to use other web applications or offline applications such as Overleaf. However, this results in students requiring multiple applications to manage their notes, thus resulting in inconvenience. Therefore, we wondered if it was possible to have a collaborative website that has a text editor which supports MarkUp languages.
